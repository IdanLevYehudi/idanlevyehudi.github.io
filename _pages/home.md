Hi! I’m a PhD student in the [Technion’s Autonomous Systems and Robotics Program](https://tasp-technion.org/), advised by [Prof. Vadim Indelman](https://vindelman.net.technion.ac.il/), head of the [Autonomous Navigation and Perception Lab (ANPL)](https://anpl-technion.github.io/).

In my research I develop algorithms that enable intelligent systems to plan and act under uncertainty.
My research focuses on planning in continuous, high-dimensional domains using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), combining ideas from Monte Carlo Tree Search, reinforcement learning, and gradient-based optimization.
I'm passionate about bridging theoretical insights and real-world deployment of autonomous systems.

I received my BSc (cum laude) in Mathematics and Physics from the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/) as part of the [Talpiot program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program).
